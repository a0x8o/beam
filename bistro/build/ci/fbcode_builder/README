This is a Python 2.6+ library designed to simplify continuous-integration
(and other builds) of Facebook projects.

The *.py files are fairly well-documented. You might want to peruse them
in this order:
 - shell_quoting.py
 - fbcode_builder.py
 - docker_builder.py
 - make_docker_context.py

This library also has an (unpublished) component targeting Facebook's
internal continuous-integration platform using the same build-step DSL.
