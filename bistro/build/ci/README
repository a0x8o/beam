# Bistro's continuous integration builds

Automatic public builds currently run on Travis CI, using Docker to exercise
several platforms.  `travis_docker_build.sh` is the Travis entry point.


## Using Docker to reproduce a CI build

If you are debugging or enhancing a CI build, you will want to do so from
host or virtual machine that can run a reasonably modern version of Docker:

```
./make_docker_context.py --help  # See available options
./travis_docker_build.sh  # Tiny wrapper that starts a Travis-like build
```

**IMPORTANT**: Read `fbcode_builder/README.docker` befire diving in!
