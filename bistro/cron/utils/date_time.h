/**
 * This is a small extension on top of boost::date_time, which handles
 * conversions between "local time labels" (e.g.  "2am, March 10, 2013") and
 * POSIX UTC timestamps.
 *
 * Our library hides two sources of complexity:
 *
 *  - Time zones. You can easily use the system time zone (pass a NULL
 *    pointer), or provide a boost::time_zone_ptr (usually created via a
 *    POSIX-like timezone format, or from the boost::date_time timezone DB).
 *
 *  - The one-to-many relationship between time labels and UTC timestamps.
 *
 *    UTC timestamps are effectively monotonic (aside from leap seconds,
 *    which are ignored in POSIX time, and are irrelevant for Cron).
 *
 *    Local time labels, on the other hand, can move forward or backward due
 *    to daylight-savings changes.  Thus, when the local clock rewinds due
 *    to DST, some local time labels become ambiguous (is it 1:30am before
 *    or after the DST rewind?).  When the local time moves forward due to
 *    DST, some local time labels are skipped (in the US Pacific timezone,
 *    2:30am never happened on March 10, 2013).
 *
 *    As a consequence, timezoneLocalPTimeToUTCTimestamps() returns a struct
 *    UTCTimestampsForLocalTime that can represent 0, 1, or 2 UTC timestamps.
 *
 *    The ambiguity could be avoided by adding an 'is_dst' flag to the local
 *    time label, but this is not useful for the purposes of Cron (and is
 *    handled adequately in existing libraries).
 *
 *    Going from UTC to a local time label is easy and unambiguous, see
 *    utcPTimeToTimezoneLocalPTime().
 *
 * CAVEAT: We use boost::posix_time::ptime to represent both UTC timestamps,
 * *and* local time labels.  This is confusing -- it would be better if
 * local time labels should used a separate type.  However, a ptime is very
 * convenient for the purpose, since it supports all the usual time
 * operations you might want to do.  Patches are welcome.
 *
 * Our library thus accounts for the following deficiencies of
 * boost::date_time:
 *
 *  - boost::date_time has almost no support for the system timezone (the only
 *    related feature is the hacky "c_local_adjustor"). In contrast, our
 *    library interprets a time_zone_ptr value of NULL as referring to the
 *    system timezone, and then does the right thing.
 *
 *  - boost::date_time has a rather annoying exception-based API for
 *    determining whether a local time label is ambiguous, nonexistent, or
 *    unique.  Our struct is much more usable.
