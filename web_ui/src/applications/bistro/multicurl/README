Does your web UI need to query a lot of servers at once? Multi-curl
dispatches a lot of concurrent self-curls against your web server as a crude
form of multi-threading.

The library abstracts away all the hard work. All you need to do is:
  1) Extend BistroBaseMultiCurlController.
  2) Add an endpoint for your controller to PhabricatorApplicationBistro.
  3) Extend BistroBaseMultiCurlClient, with the class constant
     CURL_ENDPOINT_PREFIX pointing at your endpoint.

Note that multi-curl has substantial performance overhead (see the TODO in
the base controller), so when your query parallelism is too low (under
PREF_HOSTPORTS_PER_CURL), the library does the queries serially in the main
request, with no self-curl.
